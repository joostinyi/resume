\begin{rSection}{Work Experience}
    \begin{rSubsection}{Pilon Group, UCLA}{\em April 2019 - June 2020}{Undergraduate Researcher}{}
        {\bf Deraining Model}
        \item Trained and ran an attentive generative adversarial network for image restoration of rain streak distorted
        images for applications in autonomous driving systems – using in house created datasets of 10,000+ samples.\\
        {\bf $\text{Ca}\text{(OH)}_{2}$ Synthesis}
        \item Performed reverse osmosis experiments to repurpose fracking wastewater for $\text{CO}_2$ adsorption 
        for carbon negative alternative concrete synthesis.
        \item Performed data analysis on gathered ICP-OES (spectroscopy) data to determine chemical composition of experiment samples.
    \end{rSubsection}
    \begin{rSubsection}{UAV Research, REU National Science Foundation}{\em June 2017 - August 2017}{Research Assistant}{}
        \item Studied and implemented methods for autonomous drone navigation in GPS denied environments using OpenCV and Caffe deep learning framework for Hector SLAM mapping.

\begin{rSection}{Projects}
{\bf On the Complexity and Convergence of Approximate Policy Iteration Schemes} \hfill {\em April 2020 – June 2020}
\\Literature \href{https://github.com/joostinyi/ECE239AS/blob/master/RL_S20.pdf}{survey} of approximation methods of Policy Iteration
for Markov Decision Processes to with considerations of algorithmic complexity bound analysis, convergence guarantees, and rates of convergence. 
[\href{https://github.com/joostinyi/ECE239AS/blob/master/Approximate-Policy-Iteration-Poster.pdf}{poster}]

{\bf COVID -19 Forecasting} \hfill {\em September 2020 - December 2020}
\\Performed data mining and analysis on time series data collected over an 8-month period to \href{https://github.com/yashlala/cs-145-project}{model} the infection profile
for the US – leveraged exponential smoothing (Holt Winters) and autoregressive (ARIMA) methods from the statsmodels module, with resultant MAPE of 1.26.

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Leadership Activities}
    \begin{rSubsection}{ACM at UCLA}{\em November 2019 - Present}{Workshops Officer}{}
        \item Developed and presented a 10 week \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPO7_kXilXFYGa-3ZpOXa7Z01ZYAtUh1U}{workshop}
        to teach machine learning fundamentals to a cohort of 20 undergraduate students – Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Convolutional NN, Recurrent NN.\\
        {\textbf{\em Justice, Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion}}
        \item Initiative purposed toward bringing equity, diversity, and inclusion to the forefront of ACM’s priorities through intentional dialogue,
        tangible changes to internal processes, and increased committee involvement.
        \item Integrated content and activities surrounding unfairness and algorithmic bias within AI workshops to increase discussion and awareness
        of responsible development and use of machine learning methodologies.\\
        {\textbf{\em Impact}}
        \item Founding member of a directive geared toward facilitating conversation around socially responsible engineering, social impact technology, and tech policy
        – autonomous vehicles, data privacy, big tech regulatory policy, misuses of AI, etc.\\
